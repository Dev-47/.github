## Welcome to Dev 47!

Dev 47 is an Open Source community focused on providing solutions to the immediate environments, to solve various technical problems for developers,
organizations, even businesses.

We started out as a community to help frontend developers get better at designing, then we saw potentials in the community. As we progressed with a few
projects we collaborated on, we helped each other get better at what we do and we keep doing that.

Dev 47 is a good place to build your network with other developers, find people to collaborate on your projects easily and get more answers on varieties of
topics. Contributing to group projects in Dev 47 can serve as good portfolio project and increase your chances of getting that dream job and aid personal development too.
